I am a research associate in the heterogeneous programming group at 2012 Labs of Huawei Technologies. I am interested in mixed-precision numerical computation and application. The focus is on the numerical stability and convergence analysis of mixed-precision numerical linear algebraic(NLA) algorithms. The work helps improve the robustness and generalisation of low-precision matrix algorithms, particularly for the efficient half precision arithmetics. My current research work is on:

   * Mixed-precision numerical algorithms for dense and sparse NLA;
   * High-level algorithm abstraction of [CFD simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics) and [boundary element method(BEM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_element_method) for acceleration purpose;

Previously, I had a short experience in Huawei Cambridge Research Center(CRC) as a PHD intern to provide some preliminary investigations for numerical solution of partial differential equations(PDEs). I finished my PHD study in Beihang University(BUAA) and University of Cambridge, supervised by [Prof. Xiaofeng Sun](http://shi.buaa.edu.cn/sunxiaofeng/en/index.htm) and [Prof. Paul Tucker](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/pgt23), respectively.
