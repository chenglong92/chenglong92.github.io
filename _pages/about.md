I am a research associate in the heterogeneous programming group at 2012 Labs of Huawei Technologies. My research is about mixed-precision numerical computation and application. The focus is on the numerical stability and convergence analysis of mixed-precision numerical linear algebraic(NLA) algorithms. The work helps improve the robustness and generalisation of low-precision matrix algorithms, particularly for the efficient half precision arithmetics. This is because half-precision arithmetics and domain-specific architectures(DSA) are thought to be one of the most promising routines of magically accelerating exascale super-computing applications like turbulence simulation in a 'green' way. My current research work is on:

   * Mixed-precision numerical algorithms for dense and sparse NLA;
   * Mixed-precision acceleration of high-order [CFD simulation](https://forge.osredm.com/p24036915/PHengLEI) on unstructured grid; 
   * Mixed-precision acceleration of [boundary element method(BEM)](http://bempp.com/) for acoustic and electromagnetic simulation.

Previously, I had a short experience in Huawei Cambridge Research Center(CRC) as a PHD intern to provide some preliminary investigations for numerical solution of partial differential equations(PDEs). I finished my PHD study in Beihang University(BUAA) and University of Cambridge, supervised by [Prof. Xiaofeng Sun](http://shi.buaa.edu.cn/sunxiaofeng/en/index.htm) and [Prof. Paul Tucker](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/pgt23), respectively.
